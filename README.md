# PythonChatApp

A simple chat app using Python's Kivy library 

Motivation
-----------
- wanted to learn abit more about sockets and networking 
- was familiar with tkinter and was curious to see how kivy differed in the GUI development process 


Current Progress
----------------

I have currently implemented the following:
1) a Login page where the user can set their username, i have a txt file storing usernames currently in use and ensure their are no duplicates 
2) the user can connect to the server and talk to anyone else in the same chat room 


Things to do 
------------
1) Make private chatrooms 
2) Improve the UI
3) Have a database of users and use OpenCV's facial recognition to implement basic biometric security 
4) Be able to play simple ping pong with someone in the chat room
